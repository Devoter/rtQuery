# rtQuery
An SQL abstraction library

ReTech Query is an implementation of abstraction layer between php-logic and SQL

In the code you can see some example classes like Group, User and Config.

This library supports MySQL and PostgreSQL with the same code of queries. In addition
this project contents php and bash scripts for migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL and
back (need to complete).
