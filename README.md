# rtQuery
An SQL abstraction library

ReTech Query is an implementation of abstraction layer between php-logic and SQL

This is old code, and I'm so sorry for russian comments. If someone wants to use it or
update I'll translate my comments.

In the code you can see some example classes like Group, User and Config.

I want to publish it today, therefore it have no examples, but I'll add it soon.

This library supports MySQL and PostgreSQL with the same code of queries. In addition
this project contents php and bash scripts for migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL and
back.
